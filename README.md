## About

Enduro is a browser-based obstacle racing game inspired by the classic Atari Enduro. Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, it features an 8-bit pixel-art aesthetic and progressive difficulty across four themed phases.

- **Zero dependencies** - Plain ES modules, no frameworks
- **Retro aesthetic** - 8-bit pixel-art visuals with pixelated rendering
- **Cross-platform** - Responsive controls for desktop and mobile
- **CI/CD** - Automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions

## Features

- 🎮 **8-bit pixel-art visual style** with retro color palettes
- ⌨️ **Multiple control schemes** - keyboard, mouse, and touch support
- 🏁 **4 progressive phases** with increasing difficulty and themed environments
- ❤️ **Lives system** with invulnerability timer after hits
- 🎯 **Time-based scoring** - survive longer to score higher
- 🚗 **Lane-based gameplay** with smart obstacle spawning
- ✅ **Unit tested** core game logic
- 🚀 **Auto-deployed** to GitHub Pages on every push

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Arrow Keys** or **A/D** | Switch lanes left/right |
| **Space** or **P** | Pause/unpause game |
| **R** | Restart game |
| **Mouse Click** | Click left/right side to switch lanes |
| **Touch** | Tap left/right side to switch lanes |

## Power-ups

Collect power-ups to gain temporary advantages:

- 🛡️ **Shield (Blue)** - 5 seconds of invulnerability
- ⚡ **Boost (Orange)** - 8 seconds of 2x score multiplier

Power-ups spawn every 10 seconds in random lanes. The HUD shows the active power-up and remaining time.

## Gameplay

Navigate through traffic by switching between three lanes. Avoid obstacles to survive and progress through four increasingly challenging phases:

### Phase 1: Country Roads
- **Duration:** 20 seconds
- **Speed:** 1.0x
- **Spawn Rate:** 0.4/second
- **Theme:** Rural roads with earth tones

### Phase 2: Mountain Pass
- **Duration:** 40 seconds
- **Speed:** 1.3x
- **Spawn Rate:** 0.6/second
- **Theme:** Mountainous terrain with earthy palette

### Phase 3: Desert Highway
- **Duration:** 80 seconds
- **Speed:** 1.6x
- **Spawn Rate:** 0.8/second
- **Theme:** Sandy desert roads

### Phase 4: Night City Sprint
- **Duration:** Endless
- **Speed:** 2.0x
- **Spawn Rate:** 1.0/second
- **Theme:** Dark urban environment

**Lives:** You start with 3 lives. After taking damage, you have 1.5 seconds of invulnerability.

**Scoring:** Earn 10 points per second survived. Can you reach Phase 4?

**Visual Cues:** Obstacle cars are color-coded by speed:
- 🟢 Green tint = Slower cars (easier to avoid)
- 🟡 Yellow tint = Medium speed cars
- 🔴 Red tint = Fast cars (hardest to avoid)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for running tests and ESLint)
- Modern browser with ES module support

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development server
npm start
# Game will be available at http://localhost:3000

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Pre-commit check (recommended)
npm run lint && npm test
```

```

### Architecture

- **Game Loop:** Fixed timestep at 60 FPS using accumulator pattern
- **Entities:** ES6 classes for Car and Obstacle with lane-based positioning
- **Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas with `imageSmoothingEnabled: false` for pixel-art
- **Testing:** Unit tests for core logic (collision, spawning, scoring)
- **Module System:** ES modules (.js) for browser, CommonJS (.cjs) for Node tests

## Deployment

The game automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch:

1. GitHub Actions workflow runs ESLint and tests
2. Static files are bundled into an artifact
3. Artifact is deployed to GitHub Pages
4. Site is live at https://dwildt.github.io/enduro

### Deployment Status

Check the [Actions tab](https://github.com/dwildt/enduro/actions) for deployment status and logs.

## Contributing

1. Ensure tests and linter pass before committing: `npm run lint && npm test`
2. Follow the trunk-based development workflow (work on `main`)
3. All `git push` operations must be done manually by the repository owner
4. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for AI-assisted development guidelines
